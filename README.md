# Hard of Hearing

## Step-by-Step Guide:
  
1. Install the list of dependencies 
Install the required dependencies using the package manager pip or as specified in your projectâ€™s requirements.txt file. Run the following command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

This will automatically install all the dependencies the sound classification script needs to run.

2. Run the classification Python script
Once the dependencies are installed, execute the classification script that listens for sounds in real time. Run the following command in the terminal:

```python audio_classification.py```
   
The script will continuously start listening to real-world sounds and alert if an eikon (the specific target sound) is detected.


## Pre-requisites for Accurate Detection:

1.	For optimal sound classification, place the microphone close to the oven. This ensures the microphone can pick up the target sounds more clearly, reducing interference from background noise.

2.	Use a high-quality microphone that can capture the necessary sound frequencies with precision. A good microphone will provide clear and consistent input, leading to more accurate classification by the sound detection script.
